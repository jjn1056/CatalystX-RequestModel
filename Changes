  - Break out QueryModel into a separate class and method attribute.  For backwards
    compatibility we will maintain the code for the previous approach but I recommend

  - Allow RequestModel(Model1, Model2) for more concise code when you have more than
    one request model.

  Moo/se attribute option.

0.005 - 23 July 2022
